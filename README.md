# 🎮 Word Guessing Game  

## 📖 Description  

The **Word Guessing Game** is an interactive terminal-based Python project that challenges players to guess secret words.  
It comes with different **difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard) and fun **categories** like 🍎 Fruits, 🥕 Vegetables, 🌍 Countries, and 🎬 Bollywood Celebs.  

Players either get a **limited number of attempts** (for levels) or a **time-based challenge** (for categories).  
After 5 wrong guesses, the game offers **hints** — sometimes even pulling facts directly from **Wikipedia** to keep things engaging.  

This project is:  
- A fun way to **practice Python basics** (loops, functions, file handling, conditions)  
- A simple but impressive project to add to your **portfolio**  
- Something you can actually **play with friends** 🎉
