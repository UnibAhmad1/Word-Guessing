# Word-Guessing
The Word Guessing Game is a fun and interactive terminal-based game built in Python. It challenges your vocabulary and quick thinking with different difficulty levels and categories. The game provides real-time hints after a few wrong guesses, sometimes even fetching information directly from Wikipedia.
